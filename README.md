# About Me
Nerd of all trades with 20+ years of data-centric, multifaceted experience in the USMC, the Corps of Engineers, and across such diverse industries as retail, advertising sales operations support, billing & finance, and freelance graphic design. Any day that I get to make a color-coded spreadsheet is a good day. 

<ul><b>Motivated by:</b> Curiosity, a need to see the "big picture," a lifelong drive to help people, and coffee.</ul>
<ul><b>My favorites:</b> A well-designed visualization, Green Day, Star Wars, cooking, anything by Mike Flanagan. And coffee.</ul>
